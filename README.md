### 🧠 About Me  

- I design and build **embedded control systems** using microcontrollers such as ESP32 and Raspberry Pi Pico.  
- I work with **low-level firmware (C / C++)**, handling drivers, peripherals, RTOS, DMA/PIO, and real-time processing.  
- I use **Python** for data processing, model training, and automation.  
- Currently exploring **Edge AI**, TinyML quantization, and optimization for real-time inference in constrained hardware.  
- Interested in contributing to projects related to **IoT, robotics, automation, and hardware-focused AI**.
